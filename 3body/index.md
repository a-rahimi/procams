Book Reviews and Financial Advice: The Three Body Problem

The Three Body Problem is the first book in the sci-fi series Remembrance of
Earth's Past by Cixin Liu. The series is as much a tour de force in science
fiction as it is in political science fiction.  

The story, roughly speaking goes like this (paraphrased):

Chief Mathematician of the Trisolaran Civilization: "Emperor, the bad news is that
our planet has three suns and that the gravitational interaction between three
bodies appears to be hard to predict. The good news is that we have a formal
result about the possibility of the predicting the location of the suns with
respect to each other."

Emperor of the Trisolaran Civilization: "That's good! As you know, our Empire
needs these predictions to make important scheduling decisions."

Chief Mathematician: "Yes, Emperor. We now have a tidy proof that the location
of three gravitational bodies is chaotic, meaning that slight perturbations in
their initial conditions can lead to arbitrarily large changes in their
location years later in the future. That means that the slightest errors in our
measurements, or the slightest change in the mass or the the location of the
suns today will lead to arbitrarily largely predictions two years down the
road. We're fucked."

Emperor: "How slight of a measurement error? How slight of a nudge?"

Chief Scientist: "If the mass of any of the suns were to change by as little
as a feather, their orbits will change dramatically."

In response to this hopeless situation, and abridging the remaining twelve
hundred pages of the trilogy, the Trisolarans to embark on a 400 year long
journey to invade and annex Earth as their new home world. Human thwart the
invasion in a pyrrhic victory that causes the destruction  of the Trisolaran
homeworld, Earth, the solar system, and indeed the entire universe in the hands
of unknown but much more powerful aliens.

Here's how pages 5-8 of the book could have gone instead: 

Emperor: "How slight of a measurement error? How slight of a nudge?"

Chief Mathematician: "The slightest measurement error or the weight of a feather
could move the suns into a new direction"

Emperor: "Get me my a pile of feathers and my chief feedback control system engineer."

After a brief discussion, all parties agree that while predicting the behavior
of a chaotic system is impossible, wrapping it in a  feedback control loop the
provides tiny nudges is quite easy. They build a system that very slightly
adjusts the weight of the suns and the Trisolarans go on about their lives and
ignore Earth as a distraction. The book ends on page 14 with the moral that
prediction is hard, but control doesn't always need prediction.
