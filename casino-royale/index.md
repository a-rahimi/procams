This movie sticks with you. I first watched it when it came out in 2006, and I’m reviewing it 15 years later to expunge the lingering feelings. The protagonist, a laconic investment banker named Le Chiffre (played by Mads Mikkelsen), has grown weary of his cut-throat profession and the exigencies of his limited partners, who are, for the most part, warlords and terrorists. He’s devised an all-in equity position to secure his retirement. He’s invested the entire deposit from one of his LPs (a Ugandan warlord) into a ballsy position consisting of $101,206,000 worth of short-dated out-of-the-money puts on an aerospace company. He plans to sabotage the inaugural flight of the company’s newest airplane and reap handsome profits from the ensuing dip. The astute reader will suspend disbelief that this kind of volume isn’t available on short-dated contracts even for Boeing (presumably a close proxy to Skyfleet, the movie’s aerospace company). The plan is foiled by a swashbuckling secret agent named James Bond (played by Daniel Craig), and the options expire worthless. There follows, for the next hour and fourty five minutes, a string of violence, car chases, mildly erotic couplings, and brandishing of luxury goods and product placements.


Le Chiffre is eventually fired/assassinated by his limited partners for being bad at his job. If you’re going to bomb an airplane, you don’t short the airline with OTM puts that expire on the day of your sabotage. You set the expiry to some later date. Even better, you sell call options. There are a number of risks in buying short dated OTM puts: 1) The airline might delay the launch; 2) The suicide bomber you hired might call in sick that day; 3) Aproximately what happens in the movie could happen. Buying puts with expiry after the event would let you roll your options to a later day if any of these things happen. Selling short-dated calls would be even better because your portfolio is immune to most catastrophes save a massive spike in the stock, which you’d counter with your slightly postponed bombing.


The movie never fully brings closure to Le Chiffre’s colossal financial loss, or to that of his LPs. These are profoundly emotional moments that merit unpacking. We’re also left alone to contend with a moral issue: Le Chiffre’s death a just outcome for misrepresenting his investment strategy to his clients? I don't know. I'm not a legal scholar.  I also would have liked more character development on  the investors who took the other side of the trade, collecting massive premiums from selling puts. We certainly learned nothing about why they were willing to write those contracts.
